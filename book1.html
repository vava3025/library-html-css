    <h3>Author:APJ Abdul Kalam</h3>
    <h2>summary</h2>
    <p>Some books tend to invite inspiration into our hearts on reading out some passages but here is another book that drew inspiration into the minds right from the title of the book. Former President of India Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam is christened as People’s President and is famous among the youngsters and the younger generation for the views and thoughts he instilled in them during his reign as the President of India and even after that.

        I was always fascinated by the books written by Dr.APJ Abdul Kalam right from Wings of Fire and none of his books had failed in inspiring the thoughts of the young as well as aged readers instilling faith in ourselves. Also, the title which contains the words “Life Lessons for the Youth” made it compelling to choose the book. Nonetheless, it doesn’t fail to amaze us.
        
        This book contains 18 lectures of his made during his last days to the students of India. I must really congratulate Rupa Publications for having the idea of releasing such a precious and wonderful book which every reader will look into in times of much-needed inspiration and despair.</p>
